## Software Description

---

This software allows the analysis of upper body movements using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The software converts the raw data from the IMUs into quaternions, a unique measure of orientation relative to the Earth, and then into angles of movement. A biomechanical model of the upper body was created to simulate movement and calculate relevant angles, such as abduction, flexion, rotation, and elevation of both shoulders. The open-source tool OpenSim was used to visualize and evaluate the movements in real-time. The developed system provides a novel approach to analyzing worker movements and could help improve work safety and productivity.
